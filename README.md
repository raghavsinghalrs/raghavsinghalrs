## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a **Frontend-focused Software Engineer** who enjoys building clean, scalable, and user-friendly web applications.  
I work primarily with **Angular and React**, and I like turning complex requirements into simple, intuitive UI experiences.

I believe in writing **maintainable code**, understanding things deeply (not just copy-pasting), and continuously improving both performance and design quality.

Currently, I’m focused on:
- Advanced Angular concepts & best practices
- UI architecture & component reusability
- Performance optimization in frontend apps
